<hr/>


This library attempts to provide a very simple wrapper around the Zenroom
(https://zenroom.dyne.org/) crypto virtual machine developed as part of the
DECODE project (https://decodeproject.eu/), that aims to make the Zenroom
virtual machine easier to call from normal Python code.

Zenroom itself does have good cross platform functionality, so if you are
interested in finding out more about the functionalities offered by Zenroom,
then please visit the website linked to above to find out more.


***
## üíæ Installation

```bash
pip install zenroom
```

**NOTE** - the above command attempts to install the zenroom package, pulling in
the Zenroom VM as a precompiled binary, so will only work on Linux (amd64) and macOS
machines.


***
## üéÆ Usage

Two main calls are exposed, one to run `zencode` and one for `zenroom scripts`.

If you don't know what `zencode` is, you can start with this blogpost
https://decodeproject.eu/blog/smart-contracts-english-speaker
The official documentation is available on [https://dev.zenroom.org/zencode/](https://dev.zenroom.org/zencode/)

A good set of examples of `zencode` contracts could be found on
* [zencode simple tests](https://github.com/DECODEproject/Zenroom/tree/master/test/zencode_simple)
* [zencode coconut tests](https://github.com/DECODEproject/Zenroom/tree/master/test/zencode_coconut)


### üêç Python wrapper

the wrapper exposes two simple calls:

* `zenroom_exec`
* `zencode_exec`

as the names suggest are the two methods to execute zenroom (lua scripts) and zencode.

#### args
Both functions accept the same arguments:

- `script` **[string](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str)** the lua script or
 the zencode script to be executed
- `keys` **[string](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str)** the optional keys
 string to pass in execution as documented in zenroom docs [here](https://dev.zenroom.org/wiki/how-to-exec/#keys-string)
- `data` **[string](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str)** the optional data
 string to pass in execution as documented in zenroom docs [here](https://dev.zenroom.org/wiki/how-to-exec/#data-string)
- `conf` **[string](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str)** the optional conf
 string to pass according to zen_config [here](https://github.com/DECODEproject/Zenroom/blob/master/src/zen_config.c#L99-L104)

#### return
Both functions return the same object result `ZenResult` that have two attributes:

- `stdout` **[string](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str)** holds the stdout of
 the script execution
- `stderr` **[string](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str)** holds the stderr of
 the script execution

##### Examples

Example usage of `zencode_exec(script, keys=None, data=None, conf=None)`


```python
from zenroom import zenroom

contract = """Scenario ecdh: Create a keypair"
Given that I am known as 'identifier'
When I create the keypair
Then print my data
"""

result = zenroom.zencode_exec(contract)
print(result.output)
```


Example usage of `zenroom_exec(script, keys=None, data=None, conf=None)`

```python
from zenroom import zenroom

script = "print('Hello world')"
result = zenroom.zenroom_exec(script)

print(result.output)
```

The same arguments and the same result are applied as the `zencode_exec` call.

***
## üìã Testing

Tests are made with pytests, just run 

`python setup.py test`

in (`zenroom_test.py`)[https://github.com/DECODEproject/Zenroom/blob/master/bindings/python3/zenroom/zenroom_test.py] 
file you'll find more usage examples of the wrapper
